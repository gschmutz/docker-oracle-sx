<!--
   See oracle-desktop.xss for the styles used by the desktop implementation
   of the Oracle Browser Look And Feel.  

   Note: This file is only provided by backward compatibility.  However,
   as of UIX 2.2.5, custom style sheets are no longer required to 
   explicitly import the base look and feel's style sheet.  So, rather
   than importing blaf.xss or oracle-desktop.xss, custom style sheets
   should no longer be importing any style sheet at all.  The styles
   defined in custom style sheets are automatically merged on top of
   the look and feel's style sheet (ie. on top of oracle-desktop.xss).

  No need to import oracle-desktop.xss.  We'll automatically be

         Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or other non-Latin language characters,
         you can disable dynamic image generation for OHW's UI. Note that this
         will affect all languages and will slightly degrade the appearance
         of buttons and tabs. To do so, uncomment the line below.
         (Note that another way to resolve this issue is to configure OHW
         to have proper fonts available on the server. See the release notes
         for details.) -->
